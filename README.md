# Overview
Scientific study tracking the change in a machine learning model's accuracy rates as a result of incrementing the number of randomized features that are being used. 2022-2023 AP Research project. 

## Task
The task selected to test this study on is the prediction of Parkinson's Disease in a patient by various correlated vocal measures. Data is sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Methodology
The selected two algorithms are a Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Algorithm. By selecting two algorithms that work in entirely different ways, the effect of the study is better highlighted

## Results
Classification results of each algorithm are available as Confusion Matrices in their respective files. [Link to notebook file](test.ipynb) annotated with step by step procedures.
